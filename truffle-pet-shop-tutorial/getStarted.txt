Hey so this is how you get up and running with a working codebase.

1. First you'll need to link your Ganache if you haven't done so already. I believe Truffle unbox does this for you already.
1.1. Ensure that you're pointing at Ganache in truffle-config.js

2. Second you'll need to add your smart contracts to that chain. Truffle migrate
2.1. You may need to restart Ganache if you've run out of ETH and can't deploy new contracts

3. If you like, you can also call truffle test to test

4. You'll need to serve your frontend app at some point. If you were making a next project you could just do with with "next" or "next build" and here's a guide for more https://trufflesuite.com/boxes/truffle-next/index.html
4.1. However for ease, Truffle comes preloaded with lite-server. Just write lite-server in the terminal

5. You'll need to link your frontend to your Ganache now also - thanks to app.js you request access to the provider through which the user can connect to the right network
5.1. Ensure that you're on your Ganache Metamask and not another metamask. This will give you access to test ETH
